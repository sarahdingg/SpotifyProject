## Analysis of Radioheadâ€™s Music: Factors Affecting Dancability

## Overview
This paper investigates the factors influencing the danceability of Radiohead's tracks by analyzing tempo, and valence. Our findings indicate that tempo shows no statistically significant correlation with danceability, suggesting it does not play a major role in determining the danceable quality of the songs. Valence exhibits a weak positive correlation with danceability, indicating a modest association where higher valence tracks tend to be slightly more danceable.
